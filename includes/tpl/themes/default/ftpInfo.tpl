				<li>ARKontrol comes with a FTP server that can be used to conveniently move files like mods to your game server. You can also use FTP access to download files from your server.</li>
				<li>You can connect to the server on the standard FTP port, 21, at {$smarty.server['SERVER_ADDR']}.</li>
				<li>ARKontrol's FTP server uses ports 20 and 21, as well as 30000-50000 for PASV. You may need to make allowances your workstation firewalls for these ports.</li>
				<li>ARKontrol highly recommends using <a href="https://filezilla-project.org" target="_new">FileZilla</a> as your FTP client.</li>
