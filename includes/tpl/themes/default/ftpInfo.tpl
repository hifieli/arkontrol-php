			<p>ARKontrol comes with a FTP server that can be used to conveniently move files like mods to your game server. You can also use FTP access to download files from your server.</p>
			<p>You can connect to the server on the standard FTP port, 21, at {$smarty.server['SERVER_ADDR']}.</p>
			<p>ARKontrol's FTP server uses ports 20 and 21, as well as 30000-50000 for PASV. You may need to make allowances your workstation firewalls for these ports.</p>
			<p>ARKontrol highly recommends using <a href="https://filezilla-project.org" target="_new">FileZilla</a> as your FTP client.</p>
