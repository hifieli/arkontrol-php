	Special thanks to <a href="http://gamepedia.com">Gamepedia</a>, and especially <a href="http://ark.gamepedia.com">http://ark.gamepedia.com</a>. Without the information available there, Arkontrol would have been much more difficult to produce.

	In an effort to thank <a href="http://ark.gamepedia.com">http://ark.gamepedia.com</a> you will find a number of places throughout Arkontrol where you may click for more information, and find that we have directed you to an article at Gamepedia.
